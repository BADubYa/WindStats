**Description:**

WindStats is a python script operating as an add on or extension to the Sailing Trip Planner application.  WindPlots.py generates scatter plots using matplotlib. The data used to generate the plots, originates and is updated in excel, which is then imported into an sqlite3 database for storing.  Plots are based on the Wind categories used in STP application (no wind, light wind, moderate wind, strong wind). The actual wind condition data points are added to the excel file as they are encountered.  Currently the data being used is a sample set, adn is not real data as of yet.
