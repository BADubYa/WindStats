**Description:**

WindStats is a python 3.4 script operating as an add on or extension to the Sailing Trip Planner application.  WindPlots.py generates scatter plots using matplotlib. The actual wind condition data points are collected real-time, which I then imported into an sqlite3 database for storing and querying.  Plots are based on the Wind categories used in STP application (no wind, light wind, moderate wind, strong wind). Currently the data being used is a sample set.

Currently, my python script is executed from pythons interpretive shell.
1. Creating the Database
2. Populating the Database with Data
3. Calling each plot function (4 in total) to generate each plot.
